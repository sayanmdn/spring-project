# Spring Boot Microservices Repository

Welcome to the Spring Boot Microservices Repository! Here, we host two essential microservices: `productservice` and `userservice`.

## Project Overview

### productservice
The `productservice` is a streamlined product store microservice. Its primary function is to provide users with the ability to search for products and make purchases. This microservice is designed to efficiently manage product information and facilitate seamless transactions for users.

### userservice
The `userservice` is responsible for handling authentication features within the ecosystem. It ensures secure access to the `productservice` and other related services. By managing user authentication and authorization, this microservice plays a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of the system.

## Features

- **Product Search:** Allows users to search for products based on various criteria.
- **Purchase Capability:** Enables users to buy products securely through the system.
- **User Authentication:** Provides robust authentication features to ensure secure access to services.
- **Authorization Management:** Handles authorization to control access to different parts of the system.

## Getting Started

To get started with these microservices, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone github.com/sayanmdn/spring-project.git

2. Setup Configuration
Configure the microservices according to your environment (e.g., database configurations, service ports, etc.).

3. Build and Run Microservices
1. Navigate to each microservice directory (`productservice` and `userservice`) and build the projects.
2. Run each microservice using Spring Boot's built-in tools or your preferred method.

4. Explore APIs
Once the microservices are up and running, explore the APIs provided by each service. Refer to the API documentation for detailed information on endpoints and their usage.
